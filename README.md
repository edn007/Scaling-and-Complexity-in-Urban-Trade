# Overview of the NCM & HS Table

This repository includes a detailed product classification table based on the Harmonized System (HS) and the Mercosur Common Nomenclature (NCM).

It was developed to standardize, organize, and analyze foreign trade data, enabling international comparison and precise categorization of traded goods.

## Table Structure

The data is organized into multiple levels of detail for greater analytical flexibility:

    HS Chapter (Level SH): Broad product categories (e.g., animal products, vegetable products, fats and oils).

    HS Description: Summary of the product group corresponding to each HS chapter.

    2-Digit NCM Code: NCM subdivisions for identifying more specific segments within each chapter.

    2-Digit Description: Describes the category related to the 2-digit NCM code.

    4-Digit NCM Code: An additional level of detail, allowing the identification of precise subcategories.

    4-Digit Description: Detailed description for each 4-digit segment.

This hierarchical structure facilitates advanced queries, cross-referencing, and filtering of information, from general categories to highly specific products, in line with international trade standards.
