# Abstract
Understanding how economic activity scales with urban population is central to modeling regional trade and diagnosing structural inequality. Using over 2.5 billion firm-to-firm electronic invoices across 184 municipalities from 2016 to 2019 (approximately US\$355 billion), we reconstruct a directed, product-level network of inter-city transactions and disaggregate flows into purchases, sales, and intra-city trade. All three layers scale superlinearly with population, but with distinct exponents: purchases $\approx 1.5$, sales $\approx 2.2$, and intra-city trade $\approx 2.5$, revealing a demand–supply asymmetry in which production and local circulation concentrate more strongly with city size than consumption. Moreover, revealed comparative advantages follow a truncated Zipf–Mandelbrot distribution (a power-law head with a sharp cutoff), indicating capability ceilings that constrain diversification. Extending the Fitness–Complexity framework to domestic trade, we identify persistent gaps in structural competitiveness and pinpoint municipalities with fragile or highly specialized capability portfolios. These results demonstrate that complexity dynamics, typically documented in international trade, hold robustly at the subnational scale and that urban scaling, specialization, and inequality are tightly coupled—offering a quantitative basis and toolset for regional economic planning and resilience assessment.#
